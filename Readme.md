# Data Science Assignment – Sneha Singh

This repository contains my submission for the Web3 Trading Team Data Science Assignment.

## How to Run

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload notebook_1.ipynb and run all cells.
3. Ensure raw datasets (historical_data.csv, fear_greed_index.csv) are available in your Colab environment.
4. Outputs will be generated under csv_files/ and outputs/.

## Key Insights

- Traders showed *higher leverage and volume during greed phases*, but PnL often fell.  
- *Fear phases were marked by lower risk-taking* but steadier results.  
- *Extreme greed days are often followed by net negative PnL*, making them a potential contrarian signal.  

##  Notes
- All analysis was performed in *Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)* within Colab.  
- Files are organized to match the required submission format.
